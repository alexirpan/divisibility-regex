<p><strong>Does this actually work?</strong></p>

<p>I sure hope it does! Based on my testing, it seems correct. Youâ€™re welcome
to test on your own, but use something like grep or egrep
that resolves regexes in linear time, instead of Python or Java which
resolve in up to exponential time.</p>

<p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>

<p>This constructs a discrete finite automaton (DFA) that accepts a string if and only if
it is divisible by a given number. Then, that DFA is converted to a regular
expression.</p>

<p>I used the Brzozowski Algebraic Method to do this, although several other approaches
exist.</p>

<p><strong>Why are these regular expressions so long?</strong></p>

<p>The Brzozowski method is guaranteed to return an equivalent regular expression.
It is not guaranteed to return a short one. In fact, finding the minimal
regular expression that matches a language (set of strings) is PSPACE-Complete,
and the minimal regular expression for a DFA with n states may be exponential
in n.</p>

<p>That being said, I optimized for correctness instead of length, so there
are lots of extra parantheses.</p>

<p><strong>Why does this only check divisibility up to 9?</strong></p>

<p>In principle, this algorithm works on any DFA, and can output regular
expressions that check divisibility by larger numbers. However, the length
grows exponentially in the number of states. Dividing by anything past
around 15 takes too long.</p>
